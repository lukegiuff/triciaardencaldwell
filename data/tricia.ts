  synopsis:
    `In the wake of her mother‚Äôs death, Lisa embarks on a quest in the forest, where she meets several uniquely Canadian animals that will guide her out of the forest and back home. WAKE UP is a coming-of-age story for a young adult audience that plays with concepts of logic and literary absurdity.\n\nHare drives the journey forward, pulling Lisa into the forest‚Äôs strange rhythms. Ruth, his grounded wife, encourages reflection and emotional honesty. Vixen, the fox, disrupts Lisa‚Äôs path, forcing her to confront fear, doubt, and desire.\n\nThe solemn, eclectic, yet triumphant songs evoke the melodies of our natural Canadian heritage while playing on the tender idea that you are never quite alone when walking in the dark.`,
